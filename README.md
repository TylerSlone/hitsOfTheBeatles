This project is a showcase of all of The Beatles songs that hit #1 in the USA. A user can view videos, see information about the songs, and view cover art of the songs. The user can also see a graph of all of the worldwide sales of The Beatles studio albums.

The three features I have chosen to include are:

1. Use arrays, objects, sets or
maps to store and retrieve
information that is displayed
in your app. 

- To meet this requirment I have stored information in an array of objects. On each indivdiual song choice click, information is pulled from these objects that display Artist name, song name, album name, and year released.

2. Visualize data in a user
friendly way. (e.g. graph,
chart, etc) 

- To meet this requirement I have collected data of The Beatles worldwide album sales and put them in a pie chart. The chart is accessed by clicking a button under the list of songs.

3. Retrieve data from a
third-party API and use it to
display something within your
app.

- To meet this requirement I use an API to pull in an album cover related to whichever specific song title is selected.


This project is somewhat different from my original project plan due to interest and scope, so I have included an updated project plan: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19N3oSJ8PlNqcROohq5RJNdxHaqmmJXHbkxDhaRJZjhM/edit?usp=sharing
